# My Data Science Projects

üì´ *Please feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/detapojoy) for work opportunities and collaborations on anything data science related.* üôåüèΩ
***
Portfolio of data science projects using Jupyter notebooks &amp; R elucidating the usage of data cleaning, manipulation, exploration, visualization, and modeling on a variety of datasets with real-world applications. Each folder pertains to a standalone project comprising of self-instructed as well as academic ones that have been worked on independently under supervision.

Listed below are the projects with their brief descriptions and links :

## Modeling of Credit Risk Prediction for German Bank
The objective of this project is to predict credit risk for a bank using all descriptive features of the South German Credit dataset. For this, we aim to analyse the significant features and thereafter, build a machine learning model that is able to predict whether the person (debtor), described by the attributes of the dataset, is a good (1) or a bad (0) credit risk.

## Web Scraping Steam Game Store with lxml Library
This project is to extract and access the data on Steam website in an easily readable format using lxml library. The output will be provided in a JSON format, that can be used further for other applications.

## Scraping & Analysing YouTube data using API
The main aim of this project is to scrape YouTube data by accessing the YouTube Data API, analyse it and produce some simple visualizations.

## Sign Language Action Detection in Real Time
In this project, we aim to perform real-time sign language detection using video sequences with the help of LSTM Deep Learning model using Tensorflow and Keras.

## Automated Generation of PDF Invoices
This project aims to generate invoices automatically using Python programming, by taking invoice details as input, and thereafter generating & emailing invoices in PDF format to the respective recipients.

## Exploratory Data Analysis of NBA Players 2020-21
The aim of this report is to examine the dataset for 492 NBA (National Basketball Association) players during 2020-2021 season and prepare it for further analysis by employing data cleansing methodologies. The report also explores the relationships between players‚Äô total points and other features.

## Cluster Analysis on Survival of Patients with Heart Failure Records
People with cardiovascular diseases or at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors) need early detection and management wherein a ML model can be of great help. This project analyses a dataset of patients with previous heart failures and explores the application of clustering algorithms to predict survival likelihood. Also, it examines significant risk factors affecting heart failures using EDA.

## Selective Missing Data Prediction for Memory-based Collaborative Filtering
In this project, our aim is to tackle the issue of data sparsity in Memory-based Collaborative Filtering Recommended Systems. Based on a proposed solution framework given in an academic paper, we perform Python implementation of Effective Missing Data Prediction (EMDP) algorithm and evaulate its effectiveness in recommendation.
This report also explores how and why the solution provided is able to tackle the missing value problem.

## EDA & Predictive Analytics solutions to Data@ANZ Virtual Internship on Forage platform 
This repository contains my work and solutions to the ANZ Australia's Data@ANZ Virtual Internship hosted on the Forage platform. This virtual experience program seeks to explore the transactional behaviour of ANZ customers by examining a synthesised transaction dataset containing transactions made by 100 hypothetical customers over a period of 3 months. These transactions include purchases, recurring transactions and salary transactions.
