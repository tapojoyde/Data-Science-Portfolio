# Data Science Projects
Portfolio of data science projects using Jupyter Notebooks &amp; R elucidating the usage of data cleaning, manipulation, exploration, visualization, and modeling on a variety of datasets. Each folder contains a standalone project with datasets and a notebook with real-world applications. The academic projects have been worked on independently under supervision.

Listed below are the projects with their brief descriptions :

## 1. Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey
Throughout the world of data science, there are many languages and tools that can be used to complete a given task.  This project analyses what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. The data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyse data in their daily work.

## 2. TV, Halftime Shows and the Big Game
Analysis of data from the Superbowl Halftime shows, the American football extravaganza.

## 3. Level difficulty in Candy Crush Saga
Analysis of data collected from players  of the popular game Candy Crush Saga to estimate level difficulty.

## 4. A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the worlds most well known scientific award. The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. This project looks at the data and seeks to answer questions like
1) Which sex and which country is the most commonly represented? 
2) Average age at which one gets the Nobel Prize?

## 5. Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing
This project analyses the data collected by Hungarian physician Dr Ignaz Semmelweis in the Vienna General Hospital in the 1840s to try and link childbed fever and handwashing habits (or lack thereof) among doctors delivering babies.

The link to the Jupyter notebook can be found [here](../master/Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing/notebook.ipynb)

## 6.  Where are the fishes
Marine scientists use backscatter to understand the distribution of organisms in the ocean. This project analyses active acoustic data collected from a research vessel that crossed the shelf break in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and plots the mean volume backscatter associated with fish with swim-bladders in relation to the depth of the sea floor.
